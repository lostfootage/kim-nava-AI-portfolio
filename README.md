# 🧠 AI Portfolio – Kim Nava

Welcome to my AI portfolio for **ITAI 2373 – Natural Language Processing**. This repository showcases my work and learning outcomes in building intelligent NLP systems using Python and modern AI libraries. The centerpiece of this portfolio is the **NewsBot Project**, a robust news analysis tool that integrates key NLP techniques such as text classification, sentiment analysis, summarization, and more.
